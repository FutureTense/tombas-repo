# tombas-script-repo
A collection of scripts that I use regularly

## tv_steam.sh
This is a shell script that automatically enables the HDMI Output connected to TV, set TV as primary display, and then launch Steam Big Picture. Once Steam Big Picture has closed, the display settings will be reverted.
